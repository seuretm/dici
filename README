DICI - Document Image Cluster Inspector
Also known as "a weirdly spelled 600"

This system consists in several parts:
- the embedding generator, which is based on
  https://github.com/seuretm/ocrd_typegroups_classifier/
- the projection system to turn the multidimensional data into
  2D data
- the viewer itself

Each of these parts can be started using one of the source codes which
file names start with "run_".
